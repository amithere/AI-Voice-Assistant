**Application for Sick Leave**

Date: [Current Date]

Dear [Supervisor's Name],

I am writing to inform you that I will be unable to attend work today, [Current Date], as I am currently unwell and need to take a sick leave.

I am suffering from [briefly mention your illness, e.g. fever, flu, stomach problem, etc.]. Due to my condition, I am not feeling well enough to perform my duties efficiently and require a day's rest to recover and get back to my normal self. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and will make sure to catch up on any missed work as soon as I am feeling better.

I am expecting to be back to work on [Expected Date of Return to Work]. If my condition worsens or I need to take an extended leave, I will keep you updated accordingly.

I would appreciate it if you could approve my sick leave and let me know if there are any issues or concerns.

Thank you for your understanding and support during this time.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
